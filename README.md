# GRE Preparation Tool using Flask, Python and BootStrap.

<b><h2>WORK UNDER PROGRESS</b></h2>
<p> The following readme file explains the current implementation and I will try to keep it as up to date as possible.</p>

<b><h2>Introduction</b></h2>
<p> This Preparation Tool aims to help GRE aspirants to score better by providing them with <b>practice questions, answers and video explanations</b> of each question. The practice questions belong to different topics in Quant and Verbal. The level of difficulty of these questions is similar to that of the original GRE questions.</p>

<b><h2>Web Page Flow</b></h2>
The home screen looks as below

On choosing the GRE Preparation Tool, the following web page is loaded

We can choose from any of the topics available there. If we choose quant, we get questions from different topics of Quant, whereas if we choose from Algebra alone, we get questions related to that topic i.e. - topic specific. I have chosen Quant and the question is loaded as below.
